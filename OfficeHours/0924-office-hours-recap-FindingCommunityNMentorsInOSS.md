Finding Community & Mentors in Open Source
DEI WG Community Office Hour - 09-26-2024
The OpenSSF September Community Office Hours is hosted by the DEI working group. The focus of this community office hours is on mentorship and community-building in open-source software and cybersecurity.

DEI Community Managers & Advocates shared their experiences as community managers and advocates contributing to various open-source projects. They mentioned working on Linux events and recently shifting focus to cybersecurity.

Open-source Contributors shared how they have been engaged in open-source projects for years, contributing to several Linux Foundation projects, mentoring through programs like Google Summer of Code (GSoC), and encouraging collaboration.

Topics Discussed
Mentorship vs. Coaching vs. Sponsorship: Mentorship is a long-term relationship focused on overall growth, while coaching is more short-term and skill-specific. Sponsorship involves advocacy, where a sponsor promotes the mentee in the room that isn't present.

Expectations from Mentorship: Mentors should provide feedback, resources, and opportunities while fostering a supportive environment where mentees can openly discuss challenges.

Finding Opportunities: Open-source projects and mentorship programs (like Google Summer of Code, Linux Foundation (LFX), and Outreachy) were discussed. The speakers emphasized researching projects, joining communities, and staying active on platforms like GitHub to find opportunities.

Starting Small and Building Trust: Mentees are encouraged to engage in small, manageable tasks within a project to build experience and confidence. Building trust and openly communicating between mentor and mentee are critical to a successful relationship.

Project Responsibilities to be Welcoming: Projects should have clear documentation, defined paths for newcomers, and proactively invite new contributors. If the projects do not have this, it would be a great opportunity for a newcomer to assist with. Hosting events and ensuring accessible entry points for contributors were also emphasized.

Learnings Observed
Mentees can proactively find opportunities and should not hesitate to contact mentors or join events. Take advantage of communities, attend events, and get comfortable with open-source platforms.

Maintainers should work to create clear, open, and transparent communication and pathways for new contributors. They will also continue to advertise needs, host events, and ensure newcomers feel welcome.
