# OpenSSF DEI WG Roadmap

The WG is planning for the following focus areas and activities.

You can find more detals about ongoing and past activities in our
[quarterly reports](https://github.com/ossf/tac/tree/main/TI-reports)
to the OpenSSF TAC.

## 2025

### Q1: Tip of the Month

This will be a monthly series of social media posts,
in which we highlight a specific OpenSSF community member and a career or
tech tip they would like to share with the OpenSSF and beyond.

### Q1: Welcome Calls

Other OSS foundations or communities host monthly virtual onboarding meetings,
in which new community members are given an overview of the ongoing OpenSSF
initiatives and can learn about getting involved. We are considering to
collaborate with other foundations on this.

### Q2/Q3: Mentorship

Ahead of summer 2025, the WG is seeking collaboration with
other OpenSSF TIs to enroll in the
[LFX mentorship program](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/mentorship/).
This will expose new and future
contributors to OpenSSF efforts while also advancing our efforts. As part of
this activity, the WG will likely also apply for funds to sponsor these
mentorships.

For starters, we imagine having mentorships ready for the summer, so we plan to
start doing outreach to other TIs in the late Q1/early Q2 '25 timeframe.
Looking at how other foundations do this, CNCF seems to have
[3 mentorship cycles per year](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/blob/main/programs/lfx-mentorship/README.md#program-cycles-and-archive-data), which is
something we can strive for once we have enough momentum during the summer.

### TBD: Inclusive Contributing Guidelines

There have been [a](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/330) [few](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/169) asks
to the TAC regarding the attraction and retention of maintainers. Working
together with other OpenSSF TIs, we aim to develop a small and approachable
set of contributing guidelines that focus on clear directions for project
newcomers and practices that facilitate different types of contributions.
The end goal is for our software and spec TIs to adopt these guidelines
as part of their lifecycle requirements.

### Ongoing Activities

#### 1. Community Office Hours

These are our flagship monthly topic-centered panel discussions. In 2025, our
theme will be "Safe spaces for community-focused discussions".

#### 2. Conference Participation

To continue raising awareness of different communities' needs and act as a
welcoming gateway to getting involved in the OpenSSF community, we plan to
collaborate with community members and other DEI groups to host panel
discussions and talks at different industry conferences.

Possible 2025 topics include: Hiring practices, allyship and privilege, creating
encouraging space for newcomers, and elevating different voices.

We also plan to coordinate with other DEI groups to organize meetups at
conferences.

#### 3. Improving Workflow Efficiency

We will continue our efforts in easing our preparation, documentation and
marketing workflows for our current and upcoming activities. This includes
creating documentation templates, establishing standard operating practices
(SOPs) and leveraging our existing docs and communication channels more
effectively.
